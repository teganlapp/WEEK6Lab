# WEEK6Lab
This lab will allow us to create a mini program and test out VCS.

Our program asks for the user'sage. If the user's age is less than 18, it tells the user how many more years until they turn 18. If they are 18 years old or older then the program tells them to go vote!

Tegan: I added the input for the user's name so that the program could later print their name back for them.

Group Members: Lydon Pelletier, Leah-Rose Sellinger, and Tegan Lapp
